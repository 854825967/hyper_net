Welcome to use HyperNet, it's a framework for online games.
It's designed for fast net abstract and reduce difficulty of cross process collaboration.
HyperNet only provide remote RPC, timer etc. You need design and implement your own logic.

HyperNet's document is not complete, but HyperNet is not complicated. I suggest you view source code.
HyperNet is program by C++, but you only use it without understand C++.
You need have the knowledge of multiprocess programe and divide service into different process to work together.
Lua is must. You can use HyperNet's API to accomplish collaboration between processes.
