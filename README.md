	HyperNet only provide remote RPC, timer etc. You need design and implement your own logic.
	
	HyperNet's document is not complete, but HyperNet is not complicated. I suggest you view source code.
	HyperNet is program by C++, but you only use it without understand C++.
	You need have the knowledge of multiprocess programe and divide service into different process to work together.
	Lua is must. You can use HyperNet's API to accomplish collaboration between processes.
